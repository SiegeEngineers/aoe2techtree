Use `./generateDataFiles.py` to collect unit, building and tech stats such as costs
from a json file generated by the aoe2dat project (https://github.com/HSZemi/aoe2dat),
the descriptive strings from a key-value-strings-utf8.txt file from aoe2de,
and the tech tree data from the civTechTrees.json file from aoe2de.

Example invocation:

```
./generateDataFiles.py ~/git/aoe2dat/data/full.json ~/git/aoe2dat/data/full.ror.json ~/aoe/Aoe2DE\ proton/
```
