# Data conversion Fork

This project is a fork of the aoe2techtree project for generating the seed data for the [aoe2 data api](https://github.com/amrtgaber/aoe2-data-api).

It also generates the correct filenames for the images used in [aoe2 random civ draft](https://github.com/amrtgaber/aoe2-random-civ-draft).

The conversion scripts can be found in the `data-conversion` folder.

### Images

The data conversion scripts currently do not create the images for the unique techs. Careful to avoid overwriting these images when copying the data over.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running

To run the data conversions run these two scripts in this order.

```bash
npx ts-node convert-base-data.ts
npx ts-node full-tech-tree.ts
```
